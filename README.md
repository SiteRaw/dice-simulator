# Dice Roll Simulator (Javascript)

A simple but powerful dice roll simulator in Javascript from SiteRaw Projects https://www.siteraw.com

## How it works

You can use it as a "normal" dice roll simulator. In that case leave the *rounds* input to 1.

If you want multiple *rounds* just change the input to anything between 2 and 10+.

Each subsequent *round* will use only the dice that "passed" the previous round (adjustable via the *needed* input).

Useful for [RPG type games](https://github.com/SiteRaw/Console-RPG-in-C) like DnD where there is typically more than one dice roll "sequence" involved (to hit roll, to wound roll, damage roll, etc).

**Note:** You will need the "dice.png" sprite for the visual effects. It works even without, but it's less pretty :)
